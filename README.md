# 📈 Stock Price Prediction – Mini Project

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using Machine Learning techniques. Predicting stock market movement is a challenging task, and this project demonstrates how historical stock data can be analyzed, preprocessed, and used to train a model that forecasts future stock values.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this mini project is to build a machine learning model that can predict stock prices using a dataset containing historical stock values.  
The project also includes data visualization, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical stock market data  
- Preprocess and clean the data  
- Build a machine learning model to predict future prices  
- Visualize stock trends  
- Allow users to input/upload their own dataset (optional for Streamlit)

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib 
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow/Keras  

Sources:
- Yahoo Finance  
- User-uploaded CSV  

## 🚀 How to Run

### ▶️ Run in Google Colab
1. Upload the notebook  
2. Upload dataset or download using yfinance  
3. Run all cells  


## 🔧 Machine Learning Models Used
LSTM Model - LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) widely used for sequence prediction problems such as stock price forecasting.Stock prices follow sequential patterns.So LSTM remembers past trends using memory cells.More accurate for next-day or multi-step forecasting compared to simple ML models.

## 📈 Results
- Trend visualization  
- Actual vs Predicted price comparison  
- Accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE)  
- Performance graphs  

## 🌟 Features
- Beginner-friendly ML workflow  
- Dataset upload support  
- Data preprocessing  
- Model training & prediction  

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add more deep learning architectures  
- Add technical indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA)  
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud  
- Convert model to REST API  
- Use Streamlit
